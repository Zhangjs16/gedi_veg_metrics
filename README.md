# Overview

Jupyter notebook and processing pipeline for the extraction of vegetation structural metrics from GEDI L2B data products within defined regions. The notebook is useful for quantifying vegetation condition and calculation of offsets. The processing pipeline is able to handle data that are too large to hold in memory. Relevant data from each GEDI orbit are saved to storage and then concatinated into a final shapefile and csv for analysis.
